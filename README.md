This web application is for parents who want to enrol their kids at Saint-Marc school in Alexandria, Egypt.
So, the parent is able to register in this web application, by writing his username and his passsword.
The username and password are stored in our databases called colleagues.db in a table called users; and the password is hashed for security.
Now , the parent is able to login at any time.
Inside the web app, there 5 different pages:
1-Home: With some photos of this amazing school to encourage parents.
2-About: With some information about the school (Heads of the school, and some more...)
3-Enrol: Where the parent has to include all the information of his kid (father's name, his number and email, mother's name, her number, student name, adress, and his birth date)
All this information will be stored in our databases in a table called Students. So, the school is able to get all this data.
4-Colleagues: Where we see all the studentsalready enrolled.
5-Information: Where we display the information of the user.

You can also log out.
There are also some settings:
1- Change your own password.
2- Edit your information, and once you edit any information, it will be automatically changed.
